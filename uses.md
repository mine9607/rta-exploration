"AI is helping the company enhance its shale and tight recovery in a number of ways, including improving well production and frac design, predicting potential frac hits, and optimizing chemical selection to increase recovery. It has also helped the Permian drilling and completions team learn lessons in real time that can be applied to subsequent pads. For example, the team has used AI to create a sand bridging model based on data from the drilling and completion phase to predict the likelihood a well will have issues from flowback so mitigation measures could be put in place."

Chevron is also taking advantage of the potential generative AI offers. Clark said that while Chevron went “all in” on Microsoft’s Copilot when that became available, one of the early generative AI efforts the company carried out was a look-back project of wells. It summarized data from drilling, completion, and operations logs for the engineers so “lessons learned are carried forward, but problems aren’t repeat problems.”

year ago, he said, there was some uncertainty about whether generative AI could reliably parse unstructured data—which doesn’t follow a predefined structure and is hard to analyze with traditional methods—and then insert it into structured models. Today, those efforts are yielding good results. Chevron is also working to improve a chatbot intended to assist oil and gas operations. A multiagent workflow with access to engineering and safety documents, the chatbot is a modular and scalable AI-powered assistant that can help surface the right documents and standards for team members, he said. Clark later told JPT that the focus “moving forward is to expand our application of this tool to other areas of our business as we discover potential ways to improve it.”

Nuny Rincones, reservoir engineering solutions manager at ConocoPhillips, said during the same session that the operator views generative AI “as a supercharger for how we create value” while offering the caveat that embracing the technology for the sake of embracing technology is not the right approach.

“We believe the AI gives us a competitive advantage,” she said. “Is AI a no brainer? The answer is not so fast.”

ConocoPhillips is embracing the technology, she said, while remaining aware that it’s not perfect. True benefits don’t come just from using the technology, she said. The “secret sauce” is in using the technology to develop solutions that re‑create and reimagine workflows. In short, using it to multiply impact.

Generative AI can dramatically shorten the amount of time it takes to evaluate options, such as plans for the company’s operated-by-others assets, or to optimize the strategy for disposing of produced water, she said.

“We believe technology innovation is key to do more with more and to go ahead to try to solve all those problems that still exist,” Rincones said.

Kamlesh Todai, data flow orchestration at Petrabytes Corp., said during the same session that people may believe that just because they are using AI, they will automatically become more productive or deliver better performance. But, he stressed, there needs to be training to ensure they recognize when something is wrong because of AI hallucinations, such as the model generating an incorrect answer. “If you don’t have that training, AI is not going to help.”

**While gen AI and AI technologies can reduce how long a task takes, that may not always be the case. A study released on Cornell University’s arXiv by authors from Model Evaluation & Threat Research in July found that, while experienced open-source developers believed using AI tools would reduce task completion time by 24% and estimated a 20% reduction after completing the task, the tools actually increased completion time by 19%. According to the study’s authors, developers using AI spent less time actively coding, reading, and searching for information, and instead spent time prompting AI systems, waiting for AI generations, and reviewing AI outputs. They also logged more idle time than non-AI users.**

Saxena said gen AI is becoming agentic. Gen AI is about creating information, and agentic AI is serving as the action layer, such as interpreting data.

“You have all the seismic data coming in. You’ve got geological models. You’ve got subsurface mapping. Being able to summarize those reports and being able to identify anomalies faster by asking plain English questions is a very exciting area,” he said. That capability will “accelerate time to insights on geoscience data.”

He said agentic AI could be pulled deeper into well planning and drilling. For example, properly trained AI could provide a well design plan based on the formation and it could also analyze real-time sensor data from the rig to monitor drilling activity and then recommend drilling actions like slowing the rate of penetration to improve the well’s outcome. “Think of it as a digital well drilling engineer,” he said.
